# Becca's Billotecca

I decided to build an app where users can create lists of books that they've read. Future versions of the project would include ability to add comments about the books and then to be able to see other users books and add comments to books on their lists.

I built the front end using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ember

I planned the project in stages, my first stage is the simple ability to create a reading list. My plan started with user stories, then creating an ERD and wireframes.

Here are my user stories:
As a user I want to be able to have a list of books Iâ€™ve read
As a user I want to be able to add to my list
As a user I want to be able to see my list
As a user I want to be able to delete from my list
As a user I want to be able to update book

Here is a link to my wireframe:
